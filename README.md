# Bookspeak
## Overview
### Project Name
Bookspeak
### Purpose
Bookspeak brings authors and readers together on a social media platform that gives fictional characters a voice long after their stories are over. For authors, this gives them a way to engage with their biggest fans with an option to monetize their content. For readers, this provides them entertainment by allowing them to converse with characters from their favorite books.

This platform would give authors an opportunity to publish content regularly between novel releases, and in doing so, it would provide their fans with fresh micro-stories they don't have wait months to read. This solves several problems in the publishing space on both the author and reader side:

* It gives authors more opportunities to make a living from their intellectual property by charging a premium fee for interested fans.
* Authors no longer have to rely on only royalties to make money between releases.
* It provides authors with additional content that allows new readers to find them.
* Readers will be able to chat with their favorite characters, allowing the reading experience to become more interactive.
