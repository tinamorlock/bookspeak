# Bookspeak
## Overview
### Project Name
Bookspeak
### Purpose
Bookspeak brings authors and readers together on a social media platform that gives 
fictional characters a voice long after their stories are over. For authors, this 
gives them a way to engage with their biggest fans with an option to monetize their 
content. For readers, this provides them entertainment by allowing them to converse 
with characters from their favorite books. Readers will also be able to follow those
characters like they do their own friends on other social media platforms.

This platform gives authors an opportunity to publish content regularly between 
novel releases, and in doing so, it provides their fans with fresh micro-stories 
they don't have wait months to read. 

This solves several problems in the publishing 
space on both the author and reader side:

* It gives authors more opportunities to make a living from their intellectual property by charging a premium fee for interested fans.
* Alternately, authors will also be able to offer this content for free if they choose.
* Authors no longer have to rely on only royalties to make money between releases.
* It provides authors with additional content that allows new readers to find them.
* Readers will be able to follow their favorite characters as if they were real, living people.
* Gives authors the capability to track story and series timelines easily on the backend with a relational database.
* Simplifies story and series bible creation by putting it all together on the author's private dashboard, giving them the capability to export the full document.
### Audience
There are two important audience sectors important to this project:
1. Fiction authors
2. Fiction readers
#### Fiction Authors
The fiction authors signing up for this platform create the primary content (product) for the
Bookspeak web application. Authors can create multiple pen names (if necessary), and
under each of those pen names, they will create the characters they will be posting
for. Those characters—similar to a Facebook Page—will be able to post short text
posts, videos, audio, and images. Similar to other social media platforms, followers
will be able to post and reply to comments under each post.

Why should a fiction author sign up for Bookspeak?

* They want to earn income in addition to the royalties they receive from their publishing company or book ecommerce platform.
* They want to improve their search engine optimization (SEO) and become more discoverable by new fans of their genre.
* They want to create a more engaging and unique relationship with their loyal readers.
* They want another creative tool that allows them to build more realistic characters that come to life.
* They want an easier way to create story, series, and character documentation.
#### Fiction Readers
The fiction readers signing up for this platform will be the end users who purchase 
and/or consume the content (product). They will be able to follow their favorite 
characters just like they can follow their friends on Instagram or Facebook. They 
can like and add comments; however, the Bookspeak app will not add the capability
for anyone to reply to comments.

Why should a fiction reader sign up for Bookspeak?

* They are a huge fan of the author and can't get enough of the characters from a specific story or book series.
* They want to know what happens to the character after their published story ended.
* They want to engage with their favorite authors in a unique way that makes their stories more interactive.
* They want a fun way to connect with other readers and discover new authors.
## Project Goals
1. Create detailed documentation for the Bookspeak project that outlines every stage of the process, including planning, MVP launch, premium feature integration, and AI posting. 
2. Launch a minimum viable product (MVP) by January 1, 2026. This phase will include the basic functionality of the social media platform to gather end-user feedback and validate the concept.
3. Once the app is stable, Bookspeak will give author users the ability to monetize their feed through text, audio, video, and image posts.
4. Add another premium feature with an AI component that creates posts automatically for author users.
